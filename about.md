My name is Fabio, I am still young, but not too young anymore. I love people, reading books, have a fondness for cats and complex things, and am excited to try if things work out. I like listening to music, travelling around (not too far though) and doing some sports. I publish things here in the hope that they may help, enlighten or entertain someone.

My first education was a school to become a software developer (Informatikmittelschule in Zurich). I worked as a developer several years before I decided that I wanted to go to university. Now I study law at the University of Zurich while I work as a software dev.

I had the intention to go deep into theoretical physics and started studying mathematics at the ETH Zurich. After finishing it, I switched to law at the University of Zurich. Why law? Isn&#8217;t it totally different than technical and mathematical stuff? Partially yes. Law also has a lot in common with coding and partially with maths (if you&#8217;re interested, f.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lawrence Lessig</a> does some comparisons between law and code). I was teached law in the Informatikmittelschule and was interested in it since then. For me studying law is a small adventure, something different &#8211; I like it. I also missed the human interaction while working at math stuff.

Now I still work on small projects with a team, but it&#8217;s not much. I have a student job too.
